## Tauri v2: Synchronous Commands Block the Webview

**Problem:** Tauri commands defined as `pub fn` (synchronous) run on the **main thread**. If the command does anything slow (subprocess calls, file I/O, network), it freezes the entire webview — no rendering, no animations, no user interaction.

**Symptom:** UI appears "stuck" even though JavaScript has already updated the state. The browser can't paint because the main thread is blocked by the Rust command.

**Fix:** Make slow commands `pub async fn` and use `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` for CPU/IO-bound work:

```rust
// BAD: blocks main thread
#[tauri::command]
pub fn slow_command() -> Result<String, String> {
    let result = expensive_operation(); // freezes webview
    Ok(result)
}

// GOOD: runs on background thread
#[tauri::command]
pub async fn slow_command() -> Result<String, String> {
    let result = tokio::task::spawn_blocking(|| expensive_operation())
        .await
        .map_err(|e| format!("Task failed: {}", e))?;
    Ok(result)
}
```

**Rule of thumb:** Any command that shells out (`Command::new(...)`) or does significant I/O must be async + spawn_blocking.

## PTY Broker Architecture

Sessions use a PTY broker daemon for process persistence. Single-layer PTY:

1. **Broker daemon** (`pty-broker`): holds PTY master fds, spawns commands, survives app restarts. Communicates via Unix sockets.
2. **Control socket** (`/tmp/the-controller/pty-broker.sock`): length-prefixed frames for Spawn, Kill, Resize, List, HasSession, Shutdown.
3. **Data sockets** (`/tmp/the-controller/pty-{uuid}.sock`): raw bidirectional byte streams. On connect, broker dumps a 64KB ring buffer (reconnect replay), then streams live PTY output.

Key behaviors:
- `spawn_session`: sends Spawn to broker (if not exists) + connects data socket
- `close_session`: sends Kill to broker
- App exit (`RunEvent::ExitRequested`): broker is **never** shut down — it is a persistent daemon that outlives the app
- App restart: broker + sessions survive → app reconnects on restart
- `CLAUDECODE` env var is removed in the env map sent to the broker's Spawn command

Broker binary: installed to `~/.the-controller/bin/pty-broker` at app startup. Auto-spawned by `BrokerClient` if not running. Shuts down on explicit Shutdown command or signal (SIGTERM/SIGINT).

Affected files:
- `src-tauri/src/broker_protocol.rs` — shared message types, frame encode/decode
- `src-tauri/src/broker_client.rs` — client-side broker communication
- `src-tauri/src/bin/pty_broker.rs` — the daemon binary
- `src-tauri/src/pty_manager.rs` — `spawn_session`, `close_session`, `resize_session`
- `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` — exit handler (cleans up staged sessions; broker is never shut down)

## Shell Environment Inheritance (macOS GUI)

macOS GUI apps inherit a minimal launchd environment missing `.zshrc` vars. `shell_env::inherit_shell_env()` resolves the user's full shell env at startup and applies it to the process. Must run before any threads (`set_var` is not thread-safe). For the broker, the full env map is sent explicitly in the Spawn request (with CLAUDECODE removed and PATH prepended).

Affected files: `src-tauri/src/shell_env.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/src/pty_manager.rs`

## Shell Environment Inheritance (macOS GUI)

macOS GUI apps inherit a minimal launchd environment missing `.zshrc` vars. `shell_env::inherit_shell_env()` resolves the user's full shell env at startup and applies it to the process. Must run before any threads (`set_var` is not thread-safe). For tmux, all process env vars are passed via `-e` flags in `build_create_args` because tmux sessions inherit the **server's** environment, not the client's.

Affected files: `src-tauri/src/shell_env.rs`, `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`, `src-tauri/src/tmux.rs`

## CLAUDECODE Environment Variable

Claude Code sets a `CLAUDECODE` env var to detect nested sessions. All `Command::new("claude")` calls and PTY `CommandBuilder` spawns must include `.env_remove("CLAUDECODE")` to prevent "cannot be launched inside another Claude Code session" errors.

Affected locations:
- `src-tauri/src/pty_manager.rs` — `spawn_broker_session` (removes CLAUDECODE from env map), `spawn_direct_session` (removes CLAUDECODE for direct commands)
- `src-tauri/src/config.rs` — `check_claude_cli_status`, `generate_names_via_cli`
- `src-tauri/src/maintainer.rs` — `run_health_check` (removes CLAUDECODE for health check subprocess)

## Session Status Detection via Hooks

Session status (idle/working/exited) is detected using Claude Code hooks, not PTY output heuristics.

**How it works:**
1. On app startup, a Unix domain socket listener starts at `/tmp/the-controller.sock`.
2. When spawning Claude sessions, `--settings` is passed with hook config for `UserPromptSubmit` (→ working), `Stop` (→ idle), and `Notification[idle_prompt]` (→ idle).
3. Hook commands send `status:session-id` to the socket via `nc -U`.
4. The socket listener emits `session-status-hook:<session-id>` Tauri events.
5. PTY EOF (`session-status-changed`) still handles the "exited" state.

**Key files:**
- `src-tauri/src/status_socket.rs` — socket listener, message parsing, hook JSON generation
- `src-tauri/src/pty_manager.rs` — passes `--settings` and `THE_CONTROLLER_SESSION_ID` env var
- `src/lib/Sidebar.svelte` — listens for `session-status-hook` events

**Edge cases:**
- Hook commands use `nc -w 2` + `; true` to avoid blocking Claude Code (`timeout` is not available on macOS)
- Stale socket files are cleaned up on startup
- Reattached broker sessions default to "idle" until the next hook fires

## Server Mode (Headless Browser Deployment)

The Controller can run without a desktop environment as a standalone Axum HTTP/WebSocket server (`src-tauri/src/bin/server.rs`). The Vite-built frontend is served as static files and accessed via a web browser.

**How it works:**
- The `server` Cargo feature gates `axum` and `tower-http` dependencies. The server binary lives at `src/bin/server.rs` with `required-features = ["server"]`.
- `src/lib/backend.ts` checks for `__TAURI_INTERNALS__` at load time. In desktop mode, commands go through Tauri IPC; in browser mode, they become `POST /api/{command}` requests and events flow over a shared WebSocket at `/ws`.
- `src-tauri/src/emitter.rs` defines an `EventEmitter` trait with three implementations: `TauriEmitter` (desktop), `WsBroadcastEmitter` (server), and `NoopEmitter` (tests).
- `status_socket.rs` exposes `start_listener_with_state(Arc<AppState>)` so the server binary can receive Claude Code session hooks without a Tauri `AppHandle`.

**Auth:**
- Optional bearer token via `CONTROLLER_AUTH_TOKEN` env var.
- Token is passed as a URL query param (`?token=...`) on first load, moved to `sessionStorage`, and stripped from the URL to avoid leaking via history/referrer.
- WebSocket auth uses the same token as a query param.
- Auth middleware skips static file requests; only `/api/*` and `/ws` are gated.

**Desktop-only stubs:** `copy_image_file_to_clipboard`, `capture_app_screenshot`, `start_voice_pipeline`, `stop_voice_pipeline` return errors in server mode since they require native hardware access.

**Graceful shutdown:** The server handles `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT` by cleaning up the Unix domain socket and killing all PTY/broker sessions.

**Key files:**
- `src-tauri/src/bin/server.rs` — Axum server (~2800 lines, 40+ routes)
- `src/lib/backend.ts` — dual-mode command/event routing
- `src/lib/platform.ts` — lazy Tauri imports with browser fallbacks
- `src-tauri/src/emitter.rs` — EventEmitter trait + implementations
- `src-tauri/src/status_socket.rs` — decoupled from AppHandle for server use
